For Microsoft IIS version 7 and above, if file upload is possible, there is a way to execute .asp code by modifying and uploading web.config file that is present in the root directory.

web.config defines how the website will behave. It is possible to modify it, and modify the functioning of the server, from customer error response to allowing viewing additional files remotely.
