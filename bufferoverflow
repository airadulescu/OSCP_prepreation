 buffer is a memory area intended to hold content that is often sent by the user for later processing. Some buffers have a dynamic size, while others have a fixed, preallocated size.
 
 
 how a buffer over flow exploit works:
 The general flow of a standard stack-based buffer overflow is fairly straightforward. The exploit will:

    Create a large buffer to trigger the overflow.
    Take control of EIP by overwriting a return address on the stack, padding the large buffer with an appropriate offset.
    Include a chosen payload in the buffer prepended by an optional NOP5 sled.
    Choose a correct return address instruction such as JMP ESP (or a different register) to redirect the execution flow to the payload.



Cross Compiling the Exploit code:
    sudo apt install mingw-w64
    i686-w64-mingw32-gcc <exploit>.c -o <crosscompiled>.exe
